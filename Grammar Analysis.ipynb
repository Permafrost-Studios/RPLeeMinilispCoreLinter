    "The rule `<expr> ::= <expr> <expr>*` describes function application where one expression can be followed by more expressions, such as in `(f x y)`. Without the hindsight of context, it seems the parser might get confused since `<expr>` appears on both sides of the rule and spiral into ambiguity.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key point is that the parser ALWAYS stays one step ahead using a *lookahead* symbol to decide what rule to apply next. This single symbol gives the parser enough information to tell whether it's dealing with a parenthesis operation or function application. For instance, if the next symbol is an operator such as `+`, `×`, `=`, or even a special symbol like `λ` or `≜`, the parser immediately knows that it's handling an operator expression inside parentheses. On the other hand, if the lookahead is a simple `NUMBER` or `IDENTIFIER`, it recognises that it's just a normal expression/function call.\n",
    "\n",
    "This demonstrates that although the rule `<expr> <expr>*` looks recursive and potentially messy, it's controlled. The structure of MiniLisp ensures that each kind of expression begins in a distinct way, leaving no room for confusion. The lookahead symbol acts as a relay to the parser, telling exactly which path to take.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the separation/where operator expressions always start with a special symbol, and normal expressions beginning with an identifier/number are what keeps the grammar conflict-free. This design choice makes the language both flexible and easy to parse, even though it is not initially visible."

    "The grammar used in MiniLisp is unambiguous because each expression beings in a clear and predictable way where there is only one valid interpretation for any given input. Operators such as `+`, `×`, or `=` always appear at the start of parenthesised expressions, while a simple `NUMBER` or `IDENTIFIER` represents a single atomic value. This structure ensures that when the parser encounters a token, the lookahead symbol is enough to determine which rule to apply. As a result, there is never confusion between an operation and a standalone expression, allowing the grammar to be parsed reliably without multiple interpretations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Left factoring was an important part of the grammar's design as it allowed it to work smoothly with a top-down LL(1) parser. By factoring out shared prefixes such as the opening parenthesis `(`, the grammar avoids having two or more rules that begin the same way. This means the parser can make decisions using only the next symbol without having to guess or backtrack. In practice, this makes the parsing process more efficient and predictable, helping ensure that MiniLisp expressions are interpreted consistently.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the grammar were written instead as `<expr> ::= NUMBER | IDENTIFIER | '(' <expr> ')' | '(' '+' <expr> <expr> ')' | ...`, it would cause it to be ambiguous since the parser wouldn't be able to tell whether an expression starting with `(` represents a simple parenthesised expression like `(x)` or an operation like `( + 1 2 )`. Since both rules would begin with the same lookahead token `(`, the parser wouldn't have a way of deciding which rule to follow without additional information, undermining the deterministic nature of the grammar and make it unsuitable for LL(1) parsing. Hence, the existing grammar avoids these issues by ensuring that every construct in MiniLisp begins in a distinct and recognisable way."
